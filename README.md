2. Earnings Calendar Project invovles the Naive Bayes Algorithm to predicts whether or not a specific, or multiple, stock(s) will increase within the range of 1% to 5%, the trading day following date that their earnings were released. The model justifies the variables used in the analysis, and is user friendly.
