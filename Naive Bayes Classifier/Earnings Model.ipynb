    "## Tool Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code/model has successfully created an investment tool that is based soley on technical analysis, but should be used in conjunction with fundamental practices that drive investment decisions. This model provides several different types of information to the user of the tool, of which can be used to predict whether or not a stock will increase by 1% - 5%, the day following a stock's earnings report. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume that stock x releases their earnings report after market close today. By this time, the model would be able to give a prediction on whether stock x will increase by 1% to 5% by the end of the following trading day. This would give the investor enough time to purchase the stock the following morning, and then sell before the market closes to realize the 1% to 5% gain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying algothrim used to perform predictions was the Naive Bayes Classifier. What this classifier helps determine is the probability that a certain stock x will increase by 1% to 5%, given that certain events have already occured. To be more specific, the model answers the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is the probability that the price of stock x will increase by 1% to 5%, by the time the market closes on the trading day following the reported earnings date, given that events x1 through x5 occur:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- x1 = Reported earnings per share (EPS) were higher than the previous reported date \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- x2 = Reported EPS was higher than the estimated EPS (i.e. the EPS surprise was positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- x3 = Adjusted stock price is larger than the previous reported date\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- x4 = Intraday return of the stock x, on reported date, is greater than or equal to its median intraday return of the last 5 trading days\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- x5 = Intraday return of the SPY etf is on reported date, is greater than or equal to its median intraday return of the last 5 trading days\n",

    "x_1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first event informs the investor that that growth is currently in place or that the company is becoming more efficient by decreasing their cost of goods/expenses. Both could lead to an increase interest in the company and drive the stock price up based on demand.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "x_2:\n",
    "\n",
    "The second event gives us a better understanding of how incorrect the market was at estimating the performance of a company. The higher the percentage error, also known as the surprise percentage, the better, because it signals under-valuation. During these periods, the investor has the opportunity to purchase a stock for a relatively \"low\" price and then sell at a 'fair' market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "x_3:\n",
    "\n",
    "The third event could be telling us that the market thinks that the company is going to perform well in the upcoming earnings report, and it reflects that through the price. The adjusted price was used because it takes into account any stock-splits that may have occured. However, the first event could also be a signal that the market is overvaluing the future performance of the company, potentially making it a relatively bad time to buy the stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "x_4:\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth event shows that the market has a positive sentiment regarding earnings. It is common to see a stock's intraday return fluctulate throughout the week and it is possible that one of those days, the market overvalued the stock and increased the average intraday return. Thus, the median was used to better reflect the distribution of the most recent intraday returns. If the stock increased higher than its weekly median return, it could signal that the stock has the ability to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "x_5:\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth event informs the investor on how the overall market is performing in the span of one week. The S&P 500 is index that tracks slightly over 500 publicly traded companies in the United States. This index is constantly used as a benchmark to gage how the overall market is performing. Moreover, this index is tracked by an exchange-traded-fund (ETF) called SPY that was used in this analysis. If the return on SPY, at the end of the reported date, was higher than its weekly median intraday return , it could potentially signal that the market has a positive outlook.\n"
